                        Chitragupta is a prominent figure in Hindu mythology, known as the divine
                        scribe of Yama, the god of death. He is believed to maintain a detailed record of
                        every individual's deeds, both good and bad, and plays a crucial role in the judgment
                        of souls after death. Depicted with a pen and a book, Chitragupta ensures that the actions
                        of each person are accurately noted for their afterlife journey. Revered primarily by those who
                        perform rituals for their ancestors,
                        Chitragupta is an integral part of Hindu belief regarding the soul's fate.
